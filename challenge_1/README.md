# Analyzing hypothetical checkout data

checkout_1 and checkout_2 are csvs with hypothetical checkout data used to understand if there is any kind of anomaly behavior.
In these csvs we have the number of sales of POS by hour comparing the same sales per hour from today, yesterday and the average of other days. So with this we can see the behavior from today and compare to other days.

A jupyter notebook was used to organize the solution.
